# lab_01_04_summary

This repository holds databases and Jupyter notebooks which students will use to create code to summarize quantitative data.

Students will be working individually for Parts 1 - 4 but are encouraged to move as a group. 
They will need to work collaboratively for Part 5. 

## Jupyter Notebook Workflow
As a reminder, the workflow for using Jupyter notebooks with git is as follows:

- `git clone` the Jupyter notebook repo to your local directory
- run `jupyter notebook` in your working directory
- open the .Rmb file
- Save `cmd+S` the file
- Close and halt the .Rmb file
- Open the .ipynb file and edit as usual (this will save the output as usual while automatically updating the .Rmb file)
